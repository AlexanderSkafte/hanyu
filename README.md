你好！

I'm learning Chinese. Feel free to join in.
Don't forget to make sure your browser supports Chinese characters.

**`vocab.txt`** - contains a list of words (English - Pinyin - 汉语).

**`pinyin.py`** - parses "tone numbered pinyin" to actual pinyin with correct
typographical accents. Will mess up indentation a little bit, but it shouldn't
be too big of an issue. This is so I can quickly add new words without searching
for the correct letter.

Please do note that the content is under development and not complete in any
way, shape or form.
