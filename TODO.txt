* http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Converting_tabs_to_spaces
  Note: this can be easily done in the Atom editor.

* Add a timer

* Make option to save progress to a file to continue later

* If a word contains a dash character ('-') the split will fail. Use another
  delimiter, perhaps?

* Another structure for dictionaries? Maybe something such as:
```
d = {
    'categories': {
        'family': [['brother', 'didi', '弟弟'],
                   ['sister', 'meimei', '妹妹']],
        'pronouns': []
    },
    'languages': ['en', 'py', 'cn']
}
```

* [DONE] Add HTML output

* [DONE] Show category for each word in the practice program

* [DONE] Tell the user that they can write ?pause to "pause"

* [DONE] Collect all kinds of seperators, identifiers etc in file file. Be
  consistent!

* [DONE] Add support for categories
